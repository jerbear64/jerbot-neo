# jerbot-neo

jerbot-neo is the **open-source** release of jerbot2, significantly cleaned up and effectively rewritten to the point where I feel comfortable open-sourcing it.

It is missing most functionality of jerbot2 at the moment, and is currently in planning stages. I wanted to rewrite jerbot2 from scratch at some point regardless either way, and figured this would be a good time to do it.

##Unimplemented features
Everything!

##Immediately planned features
* Initial skeleton framework, including cleaned up versions of the jerbot2 utilities.
* The ability  to define multiple API tokens in the main configuration, and easily switch between them using environment vars.
* Proper error handling and permission management.
